# MichalBr website (v3)

<p>This was the third main version of my HTML site, and even now you would still run into similar elements from the last two versions, but it has improved a lot over the last 2 versions. But something was still missing. That's also why version 3.5 was in development, but due to a lot of technical issues the development ended. With the fourth version I decided to switch to React and try something new and take the website to a new level.</p>
